            <h1>Top Picks of Ahsoka's Bookshelf</h1>
            <p>Let's touch briefly on some of the series that i happen to think are the best thing to ever be written.
            </p>
            <p>Y'all may not agree, but that's okay, because im going to talk about them anyways. If you were ever
                looking for a
                book in the fantasy/adventure genre, i would highly recommend any of these series. Or any of the books that are on my list, 
                because i refuse to believe any of the books i have read are trash.

            <h2><a href="https://thelorienlegacies.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lorien_Legacies_Wiki" target="_blank">Lorien Legacies</a></h2>
            <p>I am Number Four, from the Lorein Legacies was the book that helped me tune out everything going on
                around high school graduation,
                and let me get lost in another world. The story is about 9 children sent to Earth from a planet called
                Lorien, after their world
                was invaded by another species called the Mogodorians. A lot of aliens, i know. The 9 children are
                destined to be super-powered beings
                who will save their race from extinction, and help the people of Earth against an invasion they don't
                even know is about to happen.
                The story takes place around a high school setting which is why i was able to relate to it so well back
                in the day. It infuses some teen romance, bullying,
                and alien ass kicking in one action packed sci-fy adventure. So you know, everything you'd expect in
                highschool.
            </p>
            <p>Lorein Legacies consists of 6 books, as well as novellas, called "The Lost Files" in between each book to
                help tell the story behind certain characters that
                start joining the squad. It does a nice job of telling the story, introducing you a new character and
                completely throwing you for a loop,
                then installing a novella to help catch you up. At the time, when i was dying in wait for the next
                installment to come out, "The Lost Files" were a good way
                to satisfy my need to read the next book. Even though im no longer in the highschool phase of my life, i
                still enjoy reading these books and the current installments
                that are coming out. Pittacus Lore is currently writing his third book in the series following "The
                Lorien Legacies", call "Legacies Reborn". There was a movie
                that was made based on the book, but in my opinion, it didnt live up to it's full potential. If you see
                the movie on its own, its quite good, according to my brothers..
                But i thought they changed the characters a bit too much and left some key details out which would have
                been needed for the following books. Unfortunnately, or fortunately?(depending on how you
                look at it) the next movie was never put into production.

            <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paolini.net/biographies/christopher-paolini-full/inheritance-cycle/">Inheritance Cycle</a></h2>
            <p>Christopher Poulini is the father of dragons in book. He writes a story of a simple boy, Eragon, living in an empire with a dictator rulling 
                with an iron fist. When Eragon finds a polished blue stone, his life is turned upside down and is thrust upon an adventure he only heard about in 
                stories around the campfire. "The Inheritence Cycle" is full of dragons, magic, and adventure. I loved that it involved drawfs, elves, sword fighting scenes 
                and a story that slowly fit together as you read along. It was one of those books that would have you read something you thought was completely irrelevant 
                and turned out to be tied in all along. It kept me engaged, and as i read the series over again, i realized how much i had missed the first time around. Truly 
                a great work, but, like i mentioned in the main page, its one of those books you need to read through a bit before you fully grasp the setting and what is going 
                on in their lives.</p>

                <p>The one downfall, and im sure many of it's readers 
                will agree with me, is that Christopher left a lot of loose ends at the conclusion of the series. At the time it seemed like he was trying to torture us,
                 i certaintly felt that way, because he left no comments as to whether he would ever pick up the pen to continue writing about this universe. To make 
                 matters worse, he came out and said he was working on a new Science-Fiction book that involved space... Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.. But, out of left field, he came to our salvation 
                 a couple months ago when he release "The Fork, The Witch, and The Worm" one of many novella installments that goes on about the stories of some of the main 
                 characters after the events of "Inheritence", giving us faith that this wasnt the end of the Father of Dragons. Now all there is left to do is wait. Ugh..
            </p>
            <p>This is another book where they made a movie adaptation to it. The movie is atrocious. If you saw the movie, do NOT let that influence your perspective of the books because they are very different. That is all.. </p>
            <p>"The Inheritence Cycle" is four books long. It was orignally suppose to be 3, but there was too much content in the last book, that 
                the author decided to split it and make a fourth book. After the fourth book, there is the novella collection called "The Fork, The Witch, and The Worm". Christopher Poulini has 
                stated there will be more novella installments before he releases "Book Five" of the Inheritence Univers. I just hope he keeps his promises or there's going to be trouble.

            <h2><a href="https://www.cassandraclare.com/series/the-dark-artifices/" target="_blank">Shadowhunters</a></h2>
            <p>I use the term Shadowhunters because there is currently 3 series written by Cassandra Clare in the Shadowhunter universe. "The Mortal Instruments", 
                "The Infernal Devices", and "The Dark Artifices". "The Dark Artifices" is my all time favorite series, with my number one book, "Lord of Shadows". 
                These series are based on Nephilim,  half-angel half-human, warriors protecting the world from demons. The reason i loved "The Dark Artifices" is because i believe 
                Cassandra Clare did an excellent job in giving the characters personalities, and i felt like i could truly understand what they were going thorugh with the way she 
                wrote her stories. I was able to relate to one of the main characters, Julian, in his fierce need and want to protect his siblings from any danger that may befall them. 
                Thankfully im not having to deal with demons, but having my little brothers navigate college and become adults is its own demon in itself. Anyways, the story originally
                starts with "The Mortal Instruments" with Clary Fairchild and her band of hooligans, fighting to protect the mundane from the shadow world. You really get to see the 
                characters grow into the people they are going to become, and see how their actions will untilmately determine the type of person they will become, 
                rather than reflecting who they already are. 
             </p>
             <p>"The Mortal Instruments" was the first series published, but chronologically is currently second in line. The second series publised, and chronologically first 
                 is "The Infernal Devices" which is set in Victorian Era London. The most recent series published is "The Dark Artifices" takes place a couple years after the events of "The 
                 Mortal Instruments" events conclude. There is collections of short novellas, "The Bane Chronicles", "Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy", and "Ghosts of the Shadow Market", that 
                 tie in certain events between books and characters. There is 3 more series planned for this universe. "The Last Hours" will take place after the events of "The Infernal 
                 Devices". "The Eldest Curses" will take place in the middle of "The Mortal Instruments" and take it through after the events of "The Dark Artifices". The last series, 
                 said to be the conclusion of the Shadowhunter Universe will be titled "The Wicked Powers" and will follow the characters of "The Dark Artifices". Safe to say i have quite a bit 
                 of books to look forward to. 
             </p>
             <p>There is a movie adaptation to "The City of Bones" which i didnt think was completely terrible. Like any movie adaptation, it didnt follow the book to the dot, but still did a pretty 
                 good job. So, if you're interested in this series, but are on the fence about it, you can check out the movie "The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones." There is a TV show 
                 adaptation as well on FreeForm TV, which also does a good job of staying with most of the plot points. Unfortunnately, the second movie was a no-go, and the TV show is in 
                 its last season. The last season is suppose to be able to tie down the events of "The Mortal Instruments" series, so we will see how that turns out.

            <h2><a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/book-category/?cat=song-of-ice-and-fire" target="_blank">Song of Ice and Fire</a></h2>
            <p>The series most people may be familiar with, whether they know it or not, is this one, which the hit HBO TV show, "Game of Thrones" is based off of. 
                This is series that i actually started reading, not because of the show, but because my dad was reading the books, in spanish, and wouldnt stop nagging me 
                about it. I really should take my own advice and learn to listen to my parent's recommendation, becuase the series is fire. The show itself is amazing, dont get me wrong. 
                But the books are so much better. They go into way more detail, and there is many more characters involved in the future of Westoros. A good idea, though, is to at 
                least watch the first season of the show, to get a base understanding of the main characters. Like i said before, it can be hard to start off reading a book, and tyring to 
                understand what is going on right off the bat. Watching the first season, then reading the books definately helped me keep track of who was who, because, just like the show 
                likes to jump from one character's perspective to another, the book does that as well, but you dont have the visual picture to help you keep track.  
            </p>
            <p>George R. R. Martin, however, is like my boy Christopher Poulini. They like to torture us with the next book. "Winds of Winter", the next installment of "A Song of Ice and 
                Fire" has been in the works for years, with no end in sight to our waiting. And apparently there is another book after that, "A Dream of Spring", which is suppose to conclude 
                this epic series. It appears we may see the end of this story through television as opoosed to the books. But it will be interesting to see how the endings differ from the book 
                and television series. If im even still alive to witness the publication of the last books...
