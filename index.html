            <h2>Ahsoka's Bookshelf</h2>
            <p>I recall being a senior in high school, on the verge of graduating and about to be kicked out of momma
                bird's nest out into the
                scary adventure we call life. The constant strain of figuring out what i was going to do with the rest
                of my life. How i was going to
                survive moving to a new city to start college where i had no connections. And failing miserably at
                trying to become invisible as my ex stared
                daggers into my forhead, since i had the genius idea of ending things knowing full well i had to see her
                everyday in homeroom until graduation.
                Soccer season had finished a couple months before, and i was already starting on the freshman 15
                everyone warned about, so i couldnt rely on my lifelong
                pasttime to distract myself and try to slow things down. Luckily, i finally listened to the all knowing
                mother, sat down with a book, and lost myself in
                a new world. I may have started off reading as a temporary escape and to shut out what was going on
                around me at the time, but i am grateful for those times
                as it opened my eyes to the countless stories that people are just waiting to tell you, and i want to
                tell y'all about some of the books that have truly resonated
                with me.
            </p>

    <div class="introSect">
        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Where to start??</h2>
            <p>I can't say that a lot of people have come asking me for recommendations on what to read, or asked me how
                to get started,
                but im going to tell you how i look for a book and hope that helps you out. </p>
            <p>When i look for a book, the first step is going to be looking for a book in your general interests. Im a
                nerd and love reading about
                fantasy, adventure, and science fiction, which is the genre that most of the books i've read fall under.
                Dont
                start off with a book that you have nothing in common with. You're more likely to see something through
                if you can
                either relate to it in someway or find it interesting.
            </p>
            <p>If you're still not sure as to what kind of book to get, ask for recommendations from family or a friend
                who knows what your interests are.
                If your momma gives you a book recommendation, you know she isn't going to be wrong. Plus it'll make her
                happy. So win-win.
                As long as you havent burned any bridges with your friends, they shouldnt recommend a book that makes
                you want to bash your skull in. Just
                remember they will more than likely be recommending books they like, so make sure y'alls interests are
                similar.
            </p>
            <p>Going for top selling books or authors isnt a bad place to start either. They are top selling for a
                reason. Just go to a genre you believe
                you would like, and take a look at the reviews and comments people leave. That many people cant be
                wrong, right?
            </p>
            <p>When starting to read, you need to make sure it's the right time to read. Read when you have some time to
                yourself and wont be disturbed easily.
                Reading is also a good hobby to destress and relax your mind before bed. </p>
            <p>Last tid bit i am going to say is don't get discouraged if you don't understand whats going on right away.
                Works of fiction are all about story
                telling. However they don't always give you all the information up front, which is sometimes the point.
                It can take some time to wrap your head
                around what the setting and situation is, especially if its the first book in a series. Just push
                through and the puzzle will start putting itself
                together.

            <h2>Ahsoka</h2>
            <p>If you're a Star Wars: Clone Wars fan, you'll recognize the name "Ahsoka". They also made a book about
                her which i will talk about in the
                reviews section. I loved this character in the animated series so much, that i decided to name my pupper
                after her. The name is pronounced "ah-soh-kuh", unless your my dad who calls her "Azucar" (spanish for
                sugar) which is fine too, i guess.
                You'll see her making an appearance around the bookshelf with her buddies Jessie and Melo.
